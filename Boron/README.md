One of the 3G devices still has the old SAP IoT SIM. This needs [resetting](https://docs.particle.io/troubleshooting/guides/connectivity-troubleshooting/using-3rd-party-sim-cards/).

Also there was an update while these were unused and the device SIMs were deactivated. Need to reactivate them and also it seems add them to a [product](https://console.particle.io/products)
